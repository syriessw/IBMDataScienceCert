# IBM Data Science Professional

This repository contains exercises and projects related to the IBM Professional Certificate. Data science involves gathering, cleaning, organizing, and analyzing data with the goal of extracting helpful insights and predicting expected outcomes. The demand for skilled data scientists who can use data to tell compelling stories to inform business decisions has never been greater.

The course covers in-demand skills used by professional data scientists including databases, data visualization, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, machine learning algorithms, and data mining. Youâ€™ll also work with the latest languages, tools,and libraries including Python, SQL, Jupyter notebooks, Github, Rstudio, Pandas, Numpy, ScikitLearn, Matplotlib, and more.

## Tools Involved

Jupyter / JupyterLab, GitHub, R Studio, and Watson Studio

## Libraries

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, etc.


## Projects within

- Extract and graph financial data with the Pandas Python library
- Use SQL to query census, crime, and school demographic data sets
- Wrangle data, graph plots, and create regression models to predict housing prices with data science Python libraries
- Create a dynamic Python dashboard to improve US domestic flight reliability
- Apply machine learning classification algorithms to predict whether a loan case will be paid off
- Train and compare machine learning models

## Capstone Project

Investigate whether SpaceX Falcon 9 launches will succeed or fail.
